            <h3 id="subheading">Why NIS Semey?</h3>
            <p>Welcome, to my second blog post! Today, I am going to talk about my experience in summer programming camp called nFactorial Incubator that took place in Almaty, 2018.<br></p><img src="assets/img/DemoDay2.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
            <h5>Picture #1. The nFactorial Incubator 2018. Demo day.</h5>
            <p>To begin with, I enjoyed this camp very much, and I want to say thanks for all the organisers, mentors and managers of the camp.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There were two main study options to choose: React Native development and IOS development. I was in React Native group and mastered JavaScript and React Native throughout the course.<br></p>
            <p>I will shortly explain the daily schedule. After the two-hour lecture in the morning,&nbsp; we are required to solve tasks that are given by the mentors. Tasks were realistic and the education program targeted mostly on a practice. <br></p>
            <p>In general, indeed, during the programming camp, I felt as I am an experienced JavaScript developer and I learned other essential tools for any developer including GitHub, User Experience and User Interface, etc.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 id="subheading">Lessons</h3>
            <p>nFactorial Incubator is a camp that creates very warm but at the same time competitive atmosphere. You are not able to do other things while your surrounding is coding and working. <br></p>
            <h3 id="subheading">Homework</h3>
            <p>You want to do homework and tasks as quickly as you can and work really hard on doing it. Also, there is a ranking system, a table that represents how many points earned by each participant.<br></p>
            <h3 id="subheading">Lectures</h3><img src="assets/img/Lecture1.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
            <h5>Picture #2. Lectures during the summer camp.<br></h5>
            <p>There was one tradition that enforced our motivation by million times. At average, two times a week, we had one or a couple of guests that shared their experience and give advice for the participants. It was unusual guests including managers
                or directors of big companies, investors, programmers that are working in world leading companies as Microsoft and BMW. After the lecture, we had an unforgettable feeling that cannot be described by the words. It is a feeling when you
                start to think much broadly about your future life, what you need to do to succeed? <br></p><img src="assets/img/Lecture2.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
            <h5>Picture #3. The meeting with "YouVision".</h5>
            <p>I suppose this mental phenomenon that influenced as much as an explosion of motivation to work, read books and develop yourself. You start to set your future targets and believe that you can do it while speakers explain how can you do it.
                So, you get a vast amount of inspiration during these meetings. <br></p><img src="assets/img/Lecture3.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">

            <h3 id="subheading">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>I met lots of friends during this camp, and we still keep in touch with each other. The most excellent time was lunch in the near cafes. Although we had a lot of fun, we also learned a lot of new things from each other. <br></p>
            <p>The participation in nFactorial Incubator gave me considerable experience since I start to feel confident in myself, in my skills and also take a good motivation to work and succeed. If you are a person that has a common background in creating
                websites, JavaScript, I definitely recommend you to participate there.<br></p>
